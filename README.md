## About the Video Course
 	You do NOT need to know Bootstrap 3 for this course. Even if you already know Bootstrap 4, skip the learning sections and head right for section 6 to create the custom workflow and start the projects. Everything is completely modular! The author has created a completely custom HTML learning environment for the first few sections of this course. Each lecture has an HTML page associated with it and has a start state. As we move along through the lectures, you code along with me learning all that Bootstrap 4 offers including helpers/utilities, components, widgets, flexbox and more.Bootstrap Starter Pack - Once you get through the sandbox, we will setup the starter pack which I also created for this course. This will give us a real development workflow to compile Bootstrap 4 from source and compile Sass. It will even give us a dev server with autoload. This is what we will use for the 5 projects. We will use the Starter pack to create 5 real-world themes including: 
LoopLap - A social UI Theme
Mizuxe - A Book/Product Showcase Theme
Blogen - A blog admin area UI
Glozzom - A multi-page theme with a carousel and some 3rd party scripts
Portfoligrid - A portfolio theme using the grid, flexbox and the collapse widge
